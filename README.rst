Microbit Mailman Archive from Python.org
========================================

The micro:bit is/was a small programmable device for children created by the
BBC (in partnership with various other organisations, such as the PSF).

This mailing list was for discussion of Python on MicroBit related topics.

Respectful yet robust argument was most welcome. Engagement with humour and
intelligence won every time.

The mailing list was deleted on Friday 13th April, 2018. This repository
contains GZIPped copies of its public archives (since such mailing lists
cannot be set to archive-only mode).
